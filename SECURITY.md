# Security Policy

This project handles laundry machine operator operating workflows.
Treat vulnerabilities as potentially high impact even when the demo
data is synthetic — this domain's failure modes include real
heat/steam-burn hazard, entanglement hazard from rotating drums and
pressing mechanisms on industrial washing, drying and pressing
equipment, alongside detergent/chemical exposure and other physical
worker-safety risk.

## Do Not Disclose Publicly

Report privately before opening public issues for:

- credential exposure
- real launderer, plant or operator data exposure
- authorization bypass
- Laundry Plant Scheduling Coordination Governor bypass
- audit-ledger tampering
- over-disclosure in reports or exports
- unsafe robot action dispatch
- any path that lets a proposal reach a machine-operation-execution
  decision, a plant-safety-clearance decision, or a
  plant-safety-officer-override decision

## Reporting

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting when available for the repository.
If that is unavailable, contact the repository maintainers through the
cloud-itonami organization before publishing details.

Include:

- affected commit or version
- reproduction steps
- expected and actual behavior
- impact on launderer/plant data, policy enforcement or audit logging
- suggested fix, if known

## Production Guidance

- Store secrets outside Git.
- Keep real launderer/plant/operator data outside this repository.
- Run policy tests before deployment.
- Export and review audit logs regularly.
- Use least privilege for operators and service accounts.
